## How to Deal with Imbalanced Data using SMOTE?


With libraries like scikit-learn at our disposal, building classification models is just a matter of minutes. However, building models without properly examining the structure of your data can lead to disastrous results.

## The problem with Imbalanced Data

In classification problems, balancing your data is absolutely crucial. Data is said to be imbalanced when instances of one class outnumber the other(s) by a large proportion.

> "Feeding imbalanced data to your classifier can make it biased in favor of the majority class, simply because it did not have enough data to learn about the minority."
    
## What is SMOTE?

Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, abbreviated as SMOTE. Just like the name suggests, the technique generates synthetic data for the minority class.

SMOTE proceeds by joining the points of the minority class with line segments and then places artificial points on these lines.

Under the hood, the **SMOTE** algorithm works in 4 simple steps:
1. Choose a minority class input vector
2. Find its k nearest neighbors (k_neighbors is specified as an argument in the SMOTE() function)
3. Choose one of these neighbors and place a synthetic point anywhere on the line joining the point under consideration and its chosen neighbor
4. Repeat the steps until data is balanced

SMOTE is implemented in Python using the **imblearn** library.

In my notebook, I worked with [this data](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/downloads/creditcardfraud.zip/3) available at Kaggle.


## End Notes

There are many sampling techniques for balancing data. SMOTE is just one of them. But, thereâ€™s no single best technique. Generally, you need to experiment with a few of them before deciding on one. Make sure to check out the resources I attached above to learn about all the sampling techniques.
